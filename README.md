# hack-assembler
A Hack assembler in OCaml. A program that translates assembly code for the Hack computer into its binary representation.

This is project 6 of the [Nand to Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

To run the program, run the following

``` shell
dune exec -- ./assembler.exe <filename>.asm
```
where `<filename>.asm` is the assembly file you wish to translate. The file `<filename>.hack` should be created.
